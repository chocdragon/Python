# Python Repository

This repository holds Python codes that are done through exercises and examples that I have gone through. 

Project 1: Drinks Machine Menu
Drinks Machine Menu codes. This code prompts user for a list of drinks such as Latte, Cappuccino, Milk Tea and Hot Chocolate.
Two hidden prompts that it accepts are 'off' and 'report' for the service technician to safely turn off the machine and to report the machine's profit & resource status.

Project 2: True False Quiz
This True or False Quiz zip file contains a set of codes that makes use of the Object Oriented Programming concepts where there are:
- main.py imports the other files in, fills in the question bank, and runs the quiz while there are still questions in the list.
- data.py contains the collection of questions and answers in a dictionary called question_data
- question_model.py holds the class Question with attributes to the questions and answers.
- quiz_brain.py contains the class QuizBrain that runs the quiz engine, where it prints out the questions, checks player's answer and tallies the scores.

Project 3: Random Walk
It chooses a random direction and RGB choices of colour at every step. Runs for 150 steps #turtle #random

Project 4: Spirograph
Draws a spirograph using the turtle module. The angle is pre-defined. No inputs from user is necessary. #turtle #random

Project 5: Contemporary Spot Painting
This code creates a contemporary spot painting similar to Damien Hirst's spot painting. 
I installed a Python module called colorgram (https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/) and looked up an image for reference. The colorgram module can extract a coder defined number of colours from the provided image. In this case, I picked 20 colours. 
I randomise the 20 choices of colours to create this spot painting. #turtle #colorgram #random
